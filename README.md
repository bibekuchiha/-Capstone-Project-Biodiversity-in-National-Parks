# Capstone Project : Biodiversity in National Parks
For this project, we’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. we’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, we will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

Analyze wildlife data from several National Parks. This project will combine material from Matplotlib, Pandas, SQL, and SciPy.
